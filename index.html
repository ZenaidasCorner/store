        <h1> Welcome to Zenaida's Corner!</h1>
        <p> I'm Isabel and I love crafting! Ever since I was little I always needed some sort of creative outlet, it started off as dance and has now ventured into other skills.
            This site is a place for me to sell different items that I make- from crochet to origami.</p> 
        <p>  If you would like to order, send an email to: heyitsmeizzy1107@gmail.com.I hope you enjoy the new website and consider 
        supporting my small business. </p>

    <p>I named my small business after my gradmother, Zenaida, because my mom always told me that she'd love all the little crafts that I do. She was always a very creative and strong person. 
        She raised and taught my mom to be the strong individual she is today, despite unfortunate circumstances. 
    She pushed my mom to come to the United States so that we can have the life we have today. </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 50px"><center>About me </center></h2>

        <p>Hi! My name is Isabel and as you read above, this is my small business/store!</p> 
        <p>I started creating origami pieces back in 2019 because
        I found inspiration in an English reading assignment. This developed 
        into doing origami everywhere and anytime I could. About a year later, I saw these really cool and stylish rings that I wanted to buy. But, after closely
        looking into them, I found that I can just make them myself. So that's exactly what I did. The same principal of wanting to buy an item, but instead figuring out
    how to make them myself translated over to my now crocheting hobby. I hope that somewhere along my journey, you find a product that you like and consider supporting. 
        </p>
        <p> I love making new items and products. So if there is a piece similar to anything listed on the site, please send me an email and we can 
        work on finding something that you like!</p>
